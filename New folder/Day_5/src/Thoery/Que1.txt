que1:  What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?

Ans:-
    
    multi-threading is a programming concept in which the application can create
a small unit of tasks to execute in parallel. If you are working on a 
computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power 
to them. 

A simple program runs in sequence and the code statements execute one by one. 
This is a single-threaded application. But, if the programming language 
supports creating multiple threads and passes them to the operating 
system to run in parallel, itâ€™s called multithreading.

Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

It is important because threads use a shared memory area. They don't
allocate separate memory areas to save memory, and context-switching 
between the threads takes less time than the process.
