Q1/- Explain the meaning of the deadlock in a multithreaded application, when it can occur in
multithreading applications. Write one example of deadlock.

Ans:-
   
    deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever waiting 
     for each other. Deadlock occurs when multiple threads need the same locks bit obtain 
     them in a diff order.
     A java multithreaded program  may suffer from the deadlock condition because the synchronized 
     keyword causes the executing thread to block while waiting for the lock, or monitor,
     associated with the specified object.
