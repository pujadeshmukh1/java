difference between the Callable and Runnable interfaces.

We can create a Thread Pool as follows:
ExecutorService service=Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
Here we have created a pool of 4 threads.
After creating the pool we need to submit the tasks to this pool.

Runnable                                                 Callable
If a thread won't return anything.                      If a Thread returns anything
only one method public void run()                        only one method public Object call() throws Exception
return type void                                          return type is Object
if any exception raise as compulsory we need to
handle within try-catch.
                                                         not required to use try-catch
