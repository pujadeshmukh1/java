Q5/- What is the difference between the sleep and wait method?

Sleep(): This Method is used to pause the execution of current thread for a specified time in Milliseconds. Here, 
Thread does not lose its ownership of the monitor and resume’s it’s execution

Wait(): This method is defined in object class. It tells the calling thread (a.k.a Current Thread) to wait until another thread invoke’s
 the notify() or notifyAll() method for this object, 
The thread waits until it reobtains the ownership of the monitor and Resume’s Execution.


Wait()	                                                                         Sleep()
Wait() method belongs to Object class.	                                     Sleep() method belongs to Thread class.
Wait() method releases lock during Synchronization.	                         Sleep() method does not release the lock on object during Synchronization.
Wait() should be called only from Synchronized context.	                  There is no need to call sleep() from Synchronized context.
Wait() is not a static method.                                          	Sleep() is a static method. 
Wait() Has Three Overloaded Methods:                                                                        
wait()                                                                         Sleep() Has Two Overloaded Methods:
wait(long timeout)                                                          sleep(long millis)millis: milliseconds
                                                                       sleep(long millis,int nanos) nanos: Nanoseconds
wait(long timeout, int nanos)
